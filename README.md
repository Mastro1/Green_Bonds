# 🌱 Green Bond Classification
This project aims to classify green bonds using machine learning techniques. Green bonds are a type of financial instrument that are issued to fund environmentally friendly projects, such as renewable energy, clean water, and sustainable land use.

# 📋 Data
The data used for this project consists of descriptions of green bonds from various issuers. The data has been pre-processed and transformed into a numerical representation, suitable for use in machine learning algorithms.

# 🏋️‍♂️ Machine Learning Model
We trained and evaluated several machine learning models on the data, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. The best performing model was a logistic regression classifier, with an accuracy of 89% on the test set.

# 🔍 Results
The trained classifier was able to accurately predict the classification of green bonds with a high degree of accuracy. This can be useful for investors who are interested in identifying and investing in environmentally friendly projects.

# 🤖 Conclusion
In conclusion, we were able to successfully classify green bonds using machine learning techniques. The trained classifier can be used to accurately predict the classification of green bonds, which can help investors identify and invest in environmentally friendly projects.
