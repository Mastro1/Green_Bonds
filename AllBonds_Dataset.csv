zur nachhaltigkeit des 
\:201egreen & social schuldscheins\[opencurlydoublequote] 
der landeshauptstadt hannover2
april 2018
geltungsbereich
die imug beratungsgesellschaft (imug) wurde beauftragt, eine unabha""ngige stellungnahme  form einer \:201esecond 
party opinion\[opencurlydoublequote] u""ber die nachhaltigkeitsaspekte und das nachhaltigkeitsmanagement der emission des von der 
landeshauptstadt hannover (der \:201eemittent\[closecurlydoublequote]) erstellten green & social schuldscheins (der \:201eschuldschein\[closecurlydoublequote])
abzugeben, und zwar entsprechend der esg (environment, social und governance) -bewertungsmethode von 
vigeo eiris und  u""bereinstimmung mit den freiwilligen prozessleitlinien der green bond principles und der social 
bond principles (zusammengefasst  den \:201esustainability bond guidelines\[opencurlydoublequote] - sbg). die stellungnahme wurde unter 
aufsicht von vigeo eiris durchgefu""hrt.
die stellungnahme basiert auf der u""berpru""fung der folgenden beiden komponenten:
\:f0b7 emittent: dokumentenbasierte bewertung von esg-kontroversen und screening von kontroversen 
aktivita""ten.
\:f0b7 emission: analyse der u""bereinstimmung zwischen dem schuldschein-rahmen (framework) und der 
strategischen ausrichtung und verpflichtungen bezu""glich esg-themen des emittenten sowie eine 
dokumentenbasierte bewertung des schuldschein-rahmens.
die fu""r imug zugrundliegenden informationsquellen umfassen die datenbank von vigeo eiris, anbieter von 
presseinhalten, den emittenten selbst und dessen interessensgruppen. erga""nzt wurden diese informationen durch 
interviews mit betroffenen und involvierten abteilungen und zusta""ndigen auf seiten des emittenten, die vor ort bei 
der landeshauptstadt hannover (niedersachsen, deutschland) und mittels telefongespra""chen gefu""hrt wurden. 
imug hat seine due-diligence-pru""fung vom 1. februar bis 19. ma""rz 2018 durchgefu""hrt.
imug bekam zugang zu allen notwendigen dokumenten und konnte mit allen gewu""nschten personen sprechen. 
unseres erachtens sind wir anhand der bereitgestellten informationen  der lage, eine stellungnahme mit einem 
angemessenen masz  sicherheit bezu""glich der vollsta""ndigkeit, genauigkeit und verla""sslichkeit abzugeben.
imug-stellungnahme
imug besta""tigt, dass es sich bei dem von der landeshauptstadt hannover betrachteten green & social 
schuldschein um einen schuldschein mit positivem beitrag zur nachhaltigen entwicklung handelt, der 
 einklang mit den sustainability bond guidelines steht.
imug kann mit einem angemessenen masz  sicherheit den beitrag des schuldscheins zur o""kologischen 
und sozialen nachhaltigkeit beurteilen.3
\:f0b7 emittent (vgl. teil ):
\:f034 die landeshauptstadt hannover sieht sich einer vereinzelten kontroverse u""ber signifikante 
umweltprobleme konfrontiert (luftqualita""t/stickoxyd-werte). die landeshauptstadt hannover ist 
im allgemeinen reaktiv: sie hat zugestimmt, die kontroverse zu lo""sen.
\:f034 imug hat insgesamt 15 kontroverse aktivita""ten analysiert; die landeshauptstadt hannover ist  
keiner dieser kontroversen aktivita""ten beteiligt. 4
 
1
\:201esecond party opinion\[opencurlydoublequote]: diese stellungnahme gilt als ""second party opinion"", wie durch icma - international market association - beschrieben 
(www.icmagroup.org).
2 der green & social schuldschein gilt als potentiell zuku""nftiger schuldschein, wobei dessen emission den marktbedingungen unterliegt.
3 definition der bewertungsskalen von vigeo eiris (wie im \[opencurlydoublequote]methodik-abschnitt\[closecurlydoublequote] dieses dokuments detailliert aufgefu""hrt):
auswertungsebene: fortschrittlich, gut, eingeschra""nkt, schwach. 
masz  sicherheit: angemessen, moderat, schwach.
4 die von imug analysierten 15 kontroversen aktivita""ten sind: alkohol, tierschutz, gefa""hrliche chemikalien, zivile schusswaffen, fossile 
brennstoffindustrie, kohle, erdo""lgewinnung aus teersande und o""lschiefer, glu""cksspiel, gentechnik, angebot hochverzinster kredite, 
ru""stungsgu""ter / kontroverse waffen, kernkraft, pornographie, reproduktionsmedizin (verhu""tung und abtreibung) und tabak. 
second party opinion - green & social schuldscheins 2018 der landeshauptstadt hannover seite 2 von 15
\:f0b7 emission (vgl. teil ii): die landeshauptstadt hannover hat einen rahmen fu""r den green & social 
schuldschein (der \:201eschuldschein-rahmen\[closecurlydoublequote]) festgelegt, der fu""r die betrachtete emission des green & 
social schuldscheins anzuwenden ist. der schuldschein-rahmen steht  einklang mit den wichtigsten 
strategischen esg-ausrichtungen und wird als gut erachtet. der emittent verpflichtet sich, die second 
party opinion auf seiner website5 o""ffentlich zuga""nglich zu machen (siehe teil ii). 
\:f034 die nettoerlo""se aus dem green & social schuldschein werden zur finanzierung und 
refinanzierung von geeigneten projekten verwendet, die  zwei kategorien unterteilt werden 
ko""nnen: \:201eenergetische geba""udesanierung\[opencurlydoublequote] und \:201eunterbringung von geflu""chteten und 
obdachlosen\[closecurlydoublequote]. die projekte tragen zur abschwa""chung des klimawandels und zum zugang zu 
angemessenem, sicherem und bezahlbarem wohnraum sowie zur grundversorgung fu""r 
geflu""chtete bzw. obdachlose bei und stehen  einklang mit vier der ziele fu""r nachhaltige 
entwicklung der vereinten nationen (un sdgs). 
- der zu erwartende o""kologische nutzen im zusammenhang mit projekten zur energetischen 
geba""udesanierung ist eindeutig definiert, relevant, pra""zise und messbar. er wird vom 
emittenten bewertet und quantifiziert.
- der zu erwartende soziale nutzen im zusammenhang mit projekten zur unterbringung von 
geflu""chteten und obdachlosen ist genau definiert, relevant, pra""zise und messbar. der nutzen 
wird vom emittenten bewertet und wenn mo""glich quantifiziert.
\:f034 der prozess fu""r die bewertung und die auswahl der geeigneten projekte ist eindeutig definiert und 
steht  u""bereinstimmung mit der strategischen esg-ausrichtung und entsprechenden 
verpflichtungen der landeshauptstadt hannover. der bewertungs- und auswahlprozess des 
green & social schuldscheins wird bezogen auf transparenz und steuerung als gut betrachtet 
und stu""tzt sich auf relevante auswahlkriterien. die integration von o""kologischen und sozialen 
faktoren  den bewertungs- und auswahlprozess ist gut und umfasst die wesentlichen risiken  
zusammenhang mit den geeigneten projekten.
\:f034 die regeln fu""r das management der erlo""se sind vom emittenten eindeutig definiert und 
ermo""glichen einen dokumentierten und transparenten allokationsprozess.
\:f034 die verpflichtungen der landeshauptstadt hannover zur berichterstattung sind als gut zu 
beurteilen, mit einschra""nkungen bei den sozialen wirkungsindikatoren. berichtet wird u""ber die 
gesamt-mittelzuweisung sowie den o""kologischen nutzen der ausgewa""hlten projekte (ergebnisse 
und impacts), fu""r den sozialen nutzen werden jedoch nur ergebnisse und keine wirkungen 
(impacts) erhoben und berichtet. die aussagen zur berichterstattung des emittenten, u""ber die 
verwendung der erlo""se und den nachhaltigkeitsnutzen des green & social schuldscheins wurden 
mit einem angemessenen masz  sicherheit getroffen. wir haben eine ausweitung des monitoringund kontrollprozesses empfohlen,  dem messbare impactindikatoren fu""r soziale projekte
definiert sowie die zugrundeliegenden bewertungsmethoden und annahmen bei der quantitativen 
bestimmung festgelegt werden.
externe u""berpru""fung
die emission des green & social schuldscheins der landeshauptstadt hannover wird durch externe 
u""berpru""fungen gestu""tzt:
- die pru""fung durch einen nachhaltigkeitsberater - die \:201esecond party opinion\[opencurlydoublequote] durch die imug 
beratungsgesellschaft unter aufsicht von vigeo eiris zu den nachhaltigkeitsaspekten des green & social 
schuldscheins - basiert auf verpflichtungen des emittenten, die vor der emission des schuldscheins 
geta""tigt wurden. sie umfasst die vier kernkomponenten der sustainability bond guidelines (verwendung 
der emissionserlo""se, prozess der projektbewertung und -auswahl, management der erlo""se und 
berichterstattung).
- eine ja""hrliche u""berpru""fung - durch eine unabha""ngige pru""fstelle - umfasst die mittelzuweisung aus den 
erlo""sen des green & social schuldscheins bis zur vollsta""ndigen allokation der erlo""se. bis zur 
vollsta""ndigen ru""ckzahlung des green & social schuldscheins wird nur bei wesentlichen vera""nderungen 
der erlo""sverwendung und mittelzuweisung erneut gepru""ft.
diese stellungnahme ist mit wirkung zum emissionsdatum gu""ltig und auf den ersten green & social schuldschein
2018 der landeshauptstadt hannover begrenzt.

second party opinion - green & social schuldscheins 2018 der landeshauptstadt hannover seite 3 von 15
haftungsausschluss
transparenz u""ber die beziehung zwischen imug und dem emittenten: imug hat bisher noch keine beratungsta""tigkeiten fu""r die landeshauptstadt 
hannover ausgefu""hrt und es gibt keine (finanzielle oder anderweitige) beziehung zwischen imug und der landeshauptstadt hannover.
ziel dieser stellungnahme ist es, den investoren aufzuzeigen, warum der green & social schuldschein fu""r nachhaltig und verantwortlich erachtet 
wird, basierend auf den imug zur verfu""gung gestellten informationen, die durch imug unter der aufsicht von vigeo eiris analysiert wurden. mit dieser 
stellungnahme wird nicht beabsichtigt, dass imug die wesentlichkeit, die hervorragende leistung oder die unumkehrbarkeit der durch den green 
& social schuldschein finanzierten projekte bescheinigt. der emittent ist voll verantwortlich fu""r die bescheinigung der erfu""llung seiner  den 
richtlinien festgelegten verpflichtungen, deren ausfu""hrung und deren u""berwachung. die von imug unter aufsicht von vigeo eiris verfasste 
stellungnahme fokussiert weder auf die finanzielle leistung des green & social schuldscheins noch auf die effektive zuweisung der erlo""se. imug 
haftet nicht fu""r die sich ergebenden konsequenzen, wenn drittparteien diese stellungnahme nutzen, um entweder investitionsentscheidungen zu 
treffen oder eine andere gescha""ftliche transaktion zu ta""tigen. 
die verfasste stellungnahme bezu""glich der auf die interessensgruppen bezogenen esg-kontroversen ist keine schlussfolgerung u""ber die 
kreditwu""rdigkeit des emittenten oder seinen bestehenden finanziellen verpflichtungen. unsere stellungnahme gilt nicht als bewertung, wenn 
kontroverse aktivita""ten, produkte oder dienstleistungen durch internationale standards oder abkommen nicht verboten sind. mit der recherche 
nach kontroversen aktivita""ten ist die u""berpru""fung von unternehmen/institutionen verbunden, um die beteiligung  gescha""ftsta""tigkeiten

koha""renz der emission
der rahmen des green & social schuldscheins der landeshauptstadt hannover stimmt mit den 
wichtigsten strategischen esg-priorita""ten u""berein und tra""gt dazu bei, deren verpflichtungen und 
zielsetzungen zu erfu""llen.

landeshauptstadt hannover, die relevanten o""kologischen und sozialen themen mit den fu""r die emission 
anvisierten projekten zu adressieren.
als landeshauptstadt hat sich hannover o""ffentlich zur umsetzung des leitbildes \:201enachhaltigkeit\[opencurlydoublequote] bekannt. 1995 
wurde durch einen ratsbeschluss der anschluss  die agenda 21 unterzeichnet. 2009 erfolgte ein ratsbeschluss 
zu den milleniumentwicklungszielen, 2016 ein weitere beschluss zur 2030-agenda. die landeshauptstadt 
hannover gewann bei der verleihung des deutschen nachhaltigkeitspreises 2017 den 1. platz  der kategorie 
\:201edeutschlands nachhaltigste groszsta""dte\[opencurlydoublequote], nach dem man sich im jahr 2016 unter den top 3 platziert hatte. 2018 
wird die stadt hannover ihren ersten nachhaltigkeitsbericht vero""ffentlichen.
(1) o""kologische ausrichtung / ziele
\[bullet] die stadtverwaltung hat 2012 mit der anpassungsstrategie zum klimawandel ein auf fu""nf jahre 
angelegtes programm zur minimierung der folgen der klimaerwa""rmung erarbeitet. seit 2012 wurden viele 
masznahmen des programms bereits umgesetzt 
\[bullet] mit der agenda 2030 hat die stadt hannover vorgaben fu""r ein umweltgerechtes und nachhaltiges handeln 
der verwaltung erarbeitet. aktuelle programme setzen die agenda konkret um, darunter auch das projekt 
\:201eklimaneutrale stadtverwaltung bis 2050\[opencurlydoublequote].
\[bullet] im sommer 2014 wurde die reduzierung der treibhausgase um 95 prozent sowie des energieverbrauchs 
um 50 prozent bis zum jahr 2050 vom rat der landeshauptstadt hannover einstimmig und von der 
regionsversammlung im \:201emasterplan 100 % klimaschutz\[opencurlydoublequote] beschlossen.
\[bullet]  der klima-allianz hannover 2020 arbeitet die landeshauptstadt hannover  kooperation mit den 
stadtwerken unter beteiligung der stadtgesellschaft daran, mithilfe unterschiedlichster 
klimaschutzaktivita""ten, dass bis 2020 die ja""hrlichen co2-emissionen im stadtgebiet gegenu""ber 1990 um 
40 % gesenkt werden.
\[bullet] um den stand der co2-reduktion im stadtgebiet und damit den erfolg von klimaschutzmasznahmen zu 
bewerten, wurden co2-bilanzen fu""r die jahre 2005 sowie 2011 im vergleich zum basisjahr 1990 erstellt. 
\[bullet] die gro""szten endenergieeinsparungen sind laut einer wirksamkeitsanalyse im bereich der sta""dtischen 
liegenschaften, besonders durch die energetische sanierung, zu erreichen, dies bedeutet die 
ertu""chtigung der geba""udehu""lle. ziel ist die wirksame reduzierung des energiebedarfs von 
bestandsbauten im rahmen anstehender sanierungsmasznahmen u.. durch energetische verbesserung 
der geba""udehu""lle.
(2) soziale ausrichtung / ziele
\[bullet] die nachhaltigkeitsprinzipien - ganzheitlichkeit, generationengerechtigkeit, globale verantwortung, 
partizipation - sind  der landeshauptstadt hannover seit dem beschluss zur erarbeitung einer lokalen 
agenda 21 handlungsleitend.
\[bullet] fu""r das \[opencurlydoublequote]stadtentwicklungskonzept mein hannover 2030\[closecurlydoublequote] war u.. folgende fragestellung  der 
ausarbeitung handlungsleitend: inklusion, integration und teilhabe - wie sta""rken wir selbststa""ndiges 
leben und gesellschaftliche teilhabe?
\[bullet] um fu""r das thema \:201eflucht\[opencurlydoublequote] ein besseres versta""ndnis zu schaffen, hat die stadt hannover u""ber ihr agenda 
21- und dem nachhaltigkeitsbu""ro bereits zweimal mit der evangelischen akademie loccum zu dieser 
thematik zusammengearbeitet. daran anknu""pfend entstand das bildungsprojekt \:201efremd und doch 
vertraut\[opencurlydoublequote], das sich im aufbau befindet und auch unterrichtsangebote fu""r schulen umfassen wird. 
\[bullet] der lokale integrationsplan unterstu""tzt die verankerung der integration als querschnittsaufgabe  allen 
feldern des verwaltungshandelns sowie  der stadtgesellschaft (leitlinien zusammenleben und 
teilhabe, integrationsbeira""te, integrationsmonitoringberichte).  dem 2009 vero""ffentlichten plan wurde 
das handlungsfeld stadtverwaltung mit dem schwerpunkt der interkulturellen personal- und 
organisationsentwicklung aufgelegt und hat wesentlich zur strukturellen verankerung der interkulturellen 
o""ffnung beigetragen.
\[bullet] 2015 wurde ein sta""dtischen integrationsmanagements als ein freiwilliges und zusa""tzliches instrument der 
spezialisierten sozialen arbeit  der landeshauptstadt hannover eingerichtet. 
mit der ausrichtung auf \:201eenergetische geba""udesanierung\[opencurlydoublequote] und \:201eunterbringung von geflu""chteten und obdachlosen\[opencurlydoublequote] 
fu""gt sich der rahmen des green & social schuldscheins der landeshauptstadt hannover als ein wesentlicher teil
 die nachhaltigkeitsstrategie der landeshauptstadt hannover ein und tra""gt dazu bei, deren verpflichtungen zu 
erfu""llen. mit der emission eines green & social schuldscheins - zur anteiligen oder vollsta""ndigen finanzierung 
second party opinion - green & social schuldscheins 2018 der landeshauptstadt hannover seite 6 von 15
oder refinanzierung der definierten geeigneten projekte - reagiert die landeshauptstadt hannover stimmig auf 
ihre verpflichtung zu den oben genannten zielen.
verwendung der emissionserlo""se
die definition von geeigneten projekten fu""r den green & social schuldschein wird vom imug als eindeutig 
eingescha""tzt.
die o""kologischen zielsetzungen, die mit den geeigneten projekten zusammenha""ngen, sind eindeutig
definiert, relevant, pra""zise und messbar,  u""bereinstimmung mit den green bond principles.
\[bullet] der erwartete o""kologische nutzen aus den projekten der \:201eenergetische geba""udesanierung\[opencurlydoublequote] ist 
ebenfalls definiert, relevant, pra""zise und messbar. er wird vom emittenten bewertet und 
quantifiziert. 
die sozialen zielsetzungen, die mit den fo""rderfa""higen projekten zusammenha""ngen sind eindeutig definiert, 
relevant, pra""zise und messbar,  u""bereinstimmung mit den social bond principles.
\[bullet] der erwartete soziale nutzen aus den projekten der \:201eunterbringung von geflu""chteten und 
obdachlosen\[opencurlydoublequote] ist klar definiert, relevant, pra""zise und messbar. er wird vom emittenten bewertet
und wenn mo""glich quantifiziert. 
imug beurteilt den beitrag, der fu""r den schuldschein als geeignet ausgewa""hlten projekte zur nachhaltigen 
entwicklung aufgrund des zu erwarteten o""kologischen und sozialen nutzens als positiv. die definierten 
kategorien tragen zur abschwa""chung des klimawandels und zum zugang zu angemessen 
lebensbedingungen (wohnraum und grundversorgung) fu""r geflu""chtete und obdachlose bei.
die nettoerlo""se des green & social schuldscheins werden zur finanzierung und refinanzierung vorhandener 
und geplanter geeigneter projekte verwendet, die  zwei kategorien zusammengefasst sind und zu den 
o""kologischen und sozialen zielsetzungen beitragen.
\[bullet] energetische geba""udesanierung
\[bullet] unterbringung von geflu""chteten und obdachlosen
sollte es bei projekten zur unterbringung von geflu""chteten dazu kommen, dass keine geflu""chteten  den 
unterku""nften untergebracht werden mu""ssen, werden diese fu""r obdachlose bereitgestellt. auch ""ndert sich der 
status der geflu""chteten nach abschluss des asylverfahrens  obdachlose, sofern noch keine eigene unterkunft 
gefunden werden konnte.
zu den zula""ssigen vermo""genswerten geho""ren auch ku""rzlich erfolgte auszahlungen, die vorhandenen, laufenden 
und geplanten investitionen  hannover/deutschland entsprechen. der begriff \:201eku""rzlich\[closecurlydoublequote] bezieht sich auf 
auszahlungen, die im jahre 2016 und 2017 erfolgt sind. geplante projekte werden im jahr 2018 begonnen.
die geeigneten projekte zahlen auf definierte zielsetzungen ein, weisen einen zu erwartenden

prozess fu""r die bewertung und auswahl des projekts
imug betrachtet den bewertungs- und auswahlprozess der geeigneten projekte als eindeutig definiert und 
 einklang mit der strategischen esg-ausrichtung der landeshauptstadt hannover. der auswahl- und 
bewertungsprozess fu""r geeignete projekte des green & social schuldscheins wird bezogen auf 
transparenz und steuerung als gut bewertet, die zugrundeliegenden eignungskriterien sind relevant. der 
prozess erfolgt  u""bereinstimmung mit den vorgaben der sustainability bond guidelines.
der prozess fu""r die bewertung und auswahl der geeigneten projekte zur finanzierung und refinanzierung ist 
eindeutig definiert und formalisiert.
der prozess der landeshauptstadt hannover ist angemessen strukturiert:
- die bewertung und die auswahl der geeigneten projekte basiert auf relevanter interner expertise mit klar 
definierten internen rollen und zusta""ndigkeiten.
- fu""r diese erste emission wurde die liste der fo""rderfa""higen projekte, die durch den green & social
schuldschein finanziert und refinanziert werden sollen, kollektiv innerhalb der landeshauptstadt

- die landeshauptstadt hannover hat ein team fu""r den green & social schuldschein ernannt, das 
pru""fen wird, ob alle projekte die anspruchskriterien erfu""llen, die durch den schuldschein-rahmen 
festgelegt wurden. falls ein projekt die anspruchskriterien nicht erfu""llt (z. b. nutzungsa""nderung fu""r 
geba""ude fu""r geflu""chtete), wird das schuldschein-team beauftragt, dieses durch ein alternatives 
geeignetes projekt zu ersetzen.
- die zu leistenden investitionen werden zusa""tzlich vom nachhaltigkeitsbu""ro besta""tigt.
- zum schuldschein-team geho""ren mitarbeiter*innen des fachbereichs finanzen, bestehend aus 
vertretern aus dem sachgebiet treasury/kreditmanagement, der haushaltsabteilung, einer

second party opinion - green & social schuldscheins 2018 der landeshauptstadt hannover seite 9 von 15
der prozess stu""tzt sich auf relevante eignungskriterien. die identifikation und steuerung von esgrisikofaktoren, die mit den geeigneten projekten  zusammenhang stehen, sind als gut zu bewerten.
- die kriterien fu""r die verwendung der emissionserlo""se basieren auf der definition der kategorien fu""r 
geeignete projekte.
- zusa""tzliches auswahlkriterium: fu""r die energetische geba""udesanierung werden nur immobilien von 
o""ffentlichem interesse  den green & social schuldschein aufgenommen (z.b. schulen, kinderga""rten, 
museen, theater, feuerwachen, schwimmba""der und turnhallen). fu""r die unterbringung von geflu""chteten 
und obdachlosen werden nur unterku""nfte  den green & social schuldschein aufgenommen, die 
mindeststandards fu""r privatspha""re, hygiene und sicherheit gewa""hrleisten.
- die kriterien werden erga""nzt durch zusa""tzliche esg-kriterien, die systematisch bei der landeshauptstadt 
hannover angewandt und im sinne einer integration von esg-risikofaktoren  das projektmanagement 
verstanden werden.
- o""kologische faktoren: o""kodesign und lebensdauer, energie-management-system inkl. controlling, 
abfallmanagement, o""kologische baumaterialien, umweltschutzmasznahmen fu""r luft, wasser und 
boden, bewertung des nutzerverhaltens und auswirkungen (ggf. informationsmasznahmen zur 
effizienteren nutzung bzw. anpassung der sanierungsmasznahmen).
- soziale faktoren: qualita""tsanforderungen fu""r eingesetzte materialen und masznahmen (inkl. 
kontrollprozesse), soziale anforderungen bei dienstleistern, korruption, ilo-kernarbeitsnormen, 
einbezug der bevo""lkerung (sowohl bei baumasznahmen als auch beim betrieb der unterku""nfte fu""r 
geflu""chtete), beratungsangebote fu""r betroffene (geflu""chtete), pra""ventionsmasznahmen gegen 
gewalt und missbrauch, angebot von sprachkursen fu""r geflu""chtete.
wir haben angeregt, die einhaltung von menschenrechtsstandards und arbeitnehmerrechten  die 
monitoringprozesse beider kategorien fu""r geeignete projekte bei dienstleistern und auftragnehmern mit 
aufzunehmen.
management der erlo""se
imug bescheinigt, dass die landeshauptstadt hannover regeln fu""r das management der erlo""se eindeutig
definiert hat und dadurch ein dokumentierter, formalisiert transparenter allokationsprozess ermo""glicht 
wird. die verpflichtungen fu""r das management der erlo""se werden als gut und  u""bereinstimmung mit den 
sustainability bond guidelines betrachtet.
die nettoerlo""se des nachhaltigkeitsschuldscheins werden bei der landeshauptstadt hannover durch den 
fachbereich finanzen gemanagt. der emittent ermo""glicht eine nachvollziehbare und transparente nachverfolgung 
aller mittelzuweisungen zu den jeweiligen projekten.  der berichterstattung werden diese offengelegt.
alle projekte aus 2016 und 2017 wurden bereits durchgefu""hrt und werden teilfinanziert, da die projekte sich u""ber 
einen la""ngeren zeitraum erstrecken und z.t. von verschiedenen quellen finanziert werden, der anteil der 
finanzierten kosten wird  der berichterstattung offengelegt. projekte aus 2018 sind  planung. der anteil der 
refinanzierung  den jahren 2016 und 2017 betra""gt 100%. die verteilung der erlo""se auf bereits durchgefu""hrte 
projekte und  planung befindliche projekte wird  der berichterstattung offen gelegt.

liquidita""tsportfolio der landeshauptstadt,  bar oder anderen kurzfristigen liquiden vermo""genswerten hinterlegt.
dabei wird sichergestellt, dass die erlo""se ausschlieszlich fu""r die investitionsta""tigkeiten der geeigneten projekte 
verwendet werden.
im falle von vera""nderungen der erlo""sverwendung und mittelzuweisung z.b. durch eine vermo""gensvera""uszerung 
wird der emittent die nettoerlo""se dafu""r nutzen, um andere geeignete projekte, die mit dem vorliegenden 
rahmenwerk und hinterlegten kriterien u""bereinstimmen, zu finanzieren und entsprechend daru""ber berichten.

monitoring & berichterstattung
der prozess der datenerfassung, konsolidierung und berichterstattung wurde im schuldschein-rahmen 
eindeutig definiert und umfasst die relevanten zusta""ndigen personen der landeshauptstadt hannover,
auch auf projektebene.
die berichtspflichten des emittenten stimmen mit den sustainability bond guidelines u""berein, sie decken 
sowohl die gesamt-mittelzuweisung als auch den o""kologischen nachhaltigkeitsnutzen der finanzierten 
projekte ab. fu""r den sozialen nutzen werden jedoch nur ergebnisse (outputs) und keine wirkungen 
(impacts) erhoben und berichtet.
imug beurteilt die verpflichtungen der landeshauptstadt hannover zur berichterstattung als gut, mit 
einschra""nkungen bei den sozialen wirkungsindikatoren. imug kann dabei mit einem angemessenen masz 
 sicherheit die fa""higkeit des emittenten beurteilen, regelma""szig u""ber die verwendung der erlo""se und den 
nachhaltigkeitsnutzen des green & social schuldscheins zu berichten.
der prozess des monitorings, der datenerfassung, der konsolidierung und der berichterstattung ist klar definiert 
und formalisiert und basiert auf relevanter interner expertise.

machen.
- die landeshauptstadt hannover hat indikatoren fu""r die berichterstattung ermittelt und wird die 
berechnungsmethode auf basis von interner und externer expertise auswa""hlen.
- die projekte werden dem bericht hinzugefu""gt, sobald der emittent ein projekt als geeignet ausgewa""hlt
und festgelegt hat.
die ausgewa""hlten indikatoren fu""r die berichterstattung, die sich auf die verwendung der emissionserlo""se und den
nachhaltigkeitsnutzen der projekte beziehen, sind fu""r die o""kologischen kategorien der geeigneten projekte als 
relevant zu erachten. fu""r die kategorie \:201eunterbringung von geflu""chteten und obdachlosen\[opencurlydoublequote] werden sie als

methodik
nach einscha""tzung von imug und vigeo eiris sind o""kologische, soziale und o""konomische faktoren (esg -
environment, social, governance) miteinander verwoben und komplementa""r. als solche ko""nnen sie bei der 
bewertung des esg-managements einer organisation, aktivita""t oder transaktion nicht getrennt werden.  diesem 
sinne verfasst imug eine stellungnahme zu der gesellschaftlichen verantwortung des emittenten als institution und 
zu den zielsetzungen, zum management und der berichterstattung der jeweiligen projekte, die im zuge dieser
schuldschein-emission (re)finanziert werden.
die zugrundeliegende methodik von vigeo eiris zur definition und bewertung der esg-verantwortung basiert auf 
kriterien  u""bereinstimmung mit o""ffentlichen internationalen standards und  erfu""llung der iso 26000 richtlinie. 
sie ko""nnen  die sechs bereiche umwelt, humankapital, menschenrechte, einbindung der gesellschaft, 
gescha""ftspraktiken und gute unternehmensfu""hrung unterteilt werden. der bewertungsrahmen wurde auf die 
wesentlichen fragen zugeschnitten, und zwar auf basis des bewertungsrahmens der stadt, der jeweiligen 
projektvorhaben und aktuell relevanter fragestellungen. der due-diligence-prozess wurde von imug unter aufsicht 
von vigeo eiris gema""sz der vigeo eiris methodik durchgefu""hrt und die stellungnahme unterlag der u""berpru""fung 
durch vigeo eiris.
imug u""berpru""fte die vom emittenten, den anbietern von presseinformationen und den interessensgruppen
(partnerschaft mit factiva dow jones: zugang zum inhalt von weltweit 28.500 vero""ffentlichungen von
finanzzeitungen zu fach-magazinen bis hin zu lokalen vero""ffentlichungen oder ngos) bereitgestellten 
informationen. informationen aus diesen quellen werden nur beru""cksichtigt, sofern sie dokumentiert und 
nachvollziehbar sind. imug hat bereitgestellte dokumente und die websites des emittenten (u.. umweltstandards 
zu neubauten, zur energetischen sanierung; drucksachen zum energie-management und controlling, 
nachhaltigkeitsbericht und -strategieaussagen, lokaler integrationsplan inkl. controllingberichte, betreibervertrag 
fu""r flu""chtlingsunterku""nfte, flu""chtlingsbericht, integrationsmanagement) im zusammenhang mit der schuldscheinbewertung u""berpru""ft und perso""nliche gespra""che mit zusta""ndigen aus mehreren fachabteilungen des emittenten
gefu""hrt.
unsere forschungs- und ratingverfahren unterliegen der internen qualita""tskontrolle auf drei ebenen (analysten, 
leiter von sektoren/branchen/cluster und interne u""berpru""fung durch die auditabteilung als zweitmeinung) und 
werden durch eine schlusspru""fung und validierung durch die leitung \:201emethodik\[opencurlydoublequote] erga""nzt. 
teil . emittent
auf die interessensgruppen bezogene esg-kontroversen
eine kontroverse ist eine information, ein informationsaustausch oder eine debatte, die o""ffentlich, dokumentiert 
und nachvollziehbar ist, sowie eine anschuldigung gegen den emittenten bezu""glich fragen der 
unternehmensverantwortung. solche anschuldigungen ko""nnen sich auf konkrete fakten oder auf eine 
interpretation dieser fakten beziehen oder stellen eine behauptung unbewiesener fakten dar.
imug liefert eine stellungnahme zu den masznahmen zur risikobegrenzung der institutionen bzgl. der jeweiligen 
kontroversen, basierend auf der analyse von drei faktoren und unter aufsicht von vigeo eiris:
- schweregrad: korreliert positiv mit dem einfluss der kontroversen auf fundamentale interessen der 
anspruchsgruppen, der nachweisbarkeit der aktuellen verantwortung der institution bei eintritt des ereignisses 
und der sta""rke der negativen auswirkungen auf die interessensgruppen und institutionen. der zugeordnete 
schweregrad spiegelt den ho""chsten schweregrad aller vom unternehmen zu begegnenden fa""lle wider (skala: 
gering, erheblich, stark, kritisch).
- reaktionsfa""higkeit: die durch einen emittenten unter beweis gestellte fa""higkeit, den dialog mit seinen 
interessensgruppen aus einer risikoperspektive heraus zu fu""hren, der auf erkla""renden, pra""ventiven, 
behebenden oder korrigierenden masznahmen basiert. auf institutionsebene spiegelt dieser faktor die gesamte 
reaktionsfa""higkeit des unternehmens fu""r alle fa""lle wider, mit denen die institution konfrontiert wird (skala: 
proaktiv, behebend, reaktiv, nicht-kommunikativ).
- ha""ufigkeit: spiegelt fu""r jede esg-herausforderung die anzahl der kontroversen wider. auf institutionsebene 
spiegelt dieser faktor die gesamte anzahl der kontroversen und den umfang der sich auswirkenden esgprobleme wider (skala: vereinzelt, gelegentlich, ha""ufig, andauernd).
die auswirkung einer kontroverse auf die reputation einer institution reduziert sich mit der zeit je nach 
schweregrad des ereignisses und der reaktionsfa""higkeit der institution auf dieses ereignis. u""blicherweise deckt 
die von vigeo eiris genutzte datenbank jede kontroverse mit geringem oder erheblichem schweregrad fu""r 24 
monaten nach dem letzten registrierten ereignis und fu""r 48 monaten bei starken und kritischen kontroversen ab.
korrespondierend zu den esg-positivkriterien, ko""nnen auch die identifizierten kontroversen den sechs bereichen 
umwelt, humankapital, menschenrechte, einbindung der gesellschaft, gescha""ftspraktiken und gute 
unternehmensfu""hrung zugeordnet werden.

beteiligung  kontroversen aktivita""ten
15 kontroverse aktivita""ten wurden unter befolgung von 30 parametern zur u""berpru""fung, ob die institution  einer 
von ihnen beteiligt ist, analysiert. der grad der beteiligung der institution (erheblich, geringfu""gig, keine)  einer 
kontroversen aktivita""t basiert auf:
- einer scha""tzung der aus kontroversen produkten oder dienstleistungen abgeleiteten umsa""tze.
- der genauen art der kontroversen produkte oder dienstleistungen, die von der institution bereitgestellt 
werden.
teil ii. emission
die nachhaltigkeits-schuldschein-rahmenstruktur wurde von imug entsprechend der sustainability bond 
guidelines bewertet. die zugrunde gelegte methodik basiert auf internationalen standards und 
branchenspezifischen richtlinien  bezug auf esg-management und bewertung.
verwendung der erlo""se
die vorgaben fu""r die verwendung der erlo""se werden definiert, um sicherzustellen, dass die aufgebrachten 
geldmittel zur finanzierung und/oder refinanzierung der geeigneten produkte verwendet werden und innerhalb 
der emittierenden organisation nachvollziehbar sind. projekte, die mindestens eine der definierten kategorien fu""r 
geeignete projekte erfu""llen, gelten als geeignet. imug bewertet relevanz, darstellung und messbarkeit der damit 
verbundenen o""kologischen und/oder sozialen zielsetzungen. das nachhaltigkeitsziel des schuldscheins im 
zusammenhang mit den geeigneten projekten wurde bezu""glich der verpflichtungen des emittenten eindeutig 
definiert und anhand der beschriebenen und gescha""tzten vorteile der geeigneten projekte bewertet. der beitrag 
der geeigneten projekte zur nachhaltigen entwicklung wurde auf basis der ziele zur nachhaltigen entwicklung der 
vereinten nationen bewertet.
prozess fu""r die bewertung und auswahl des projekts
die bewertung und der auswahlprozess wurden von imug hinsichtlich ihrer transparenz, steuerung und effizienz 
bewertet. die relevanz und ausfu""hrlichkeit der auswahlkriterien und die damit zusammenha""ngenden elemente 
der unterstu""tzung, die  dem schuldschein-rahmen integriert sind, sowie die stimmigkeit des prozesses werden 
auf basis der  der vigeo eiris methodik beru""cksichtigten wesentlichen fragen analysiert.
management der erlo""se
die regeln fu""r das management der erlo""se und der zuweisungsprozess wurden von imug hinsichtlich transparenz, 
koha""renz und effizienz bewertet.
berichterstattung
die indikatoren fu""r die berichterstattung, prozesse und methoden werden vom emittenten definiert und 
ermo""glichen eine ja""hrliche berichterstattung u""ber die mittelzuweisung, den nachhaltigkeitsnutzen (indikatoren fu""r 
ergebnisse und auswirkungen) und das verantwortliche management der durch die erlo""se des schuldscheins 
finanzierten geeigneten projekte. imug hat die relevanz der rahmenstruktur fu""r die berichterstattung nach drei
